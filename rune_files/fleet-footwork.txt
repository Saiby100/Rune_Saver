Moving and basic attacking generates Energize stacks, up to 100.

When fully Energized, your next basic attack heals you for 10âˆ’100 (+0.3 bonus attack damage) (+20% ability power) (depending on level) and grants 20% bonus movement speed for 1 second. Against minions, the healing is (20% for Melee / 10% for Ranged) effective.
