Immobilizing an enemy champion will cause 3 glacial rays to emanate from them towards you and other nearby enemy champions, creating icy zones that slow enemies within by 30% (+3% per 100 ability power) (+4% per 100 bonus attack damage) (+9% per 10% heal and shield power) and reducing their damage by 15% against your allies, excluding yourself, for 3 seconds (+100% of the immobilizing effect's duration).

Cooldown: 25 seconds
