Consuming a potion or biscuit grants 30% of its health immediately, and mana if applicable. Health/mana per tick is then reduced by half for the effect's regular duration. If consumables are stacked, the instant restoration is applied after the duration of the initial consumable ends.

Additionally, you gain 4% bonus movement speed while under the effect of a potion or biscuit.
